***Without proxies:***
![No Proxy](https://github.com/kokiez/hcaptcha-solver-text-based/blob/main/3-withoutproxy.png)

## ‚ùó Important Note 
This project only supports a sitekey which does provide a ***TEXT-Challenge***.
It might not work on all types of Challenges.

# üì• Installating Requirements
1. Run the file named **install_requirements.bat**.
2. You will be required an open ai api key:
   - Worry not, the api key on first time provides 18 USD of credits. Which will take long to end. 
   - You can get api key by going [here](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
   - Ask the AI 'how to obtain an open ai key'
   - It will guide from A to Z.
   - Once key is obtained, go to data>api-secret.txt in this project and paste the open ai key in txt file. Then save it.
